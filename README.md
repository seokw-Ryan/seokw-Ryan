# 👋 Hi, I'm Ryan Chung

🎓 I'm an Electrical Engineering student at The Cooper Union.  
⚙️ I explore the intersection of **AI hardware**, **low-level programming**, and **quantum computing** — driven by curiosity and the belief that compute will define our future.  


## 🔬 Current Focus

- 🧩 **AI agent architectures** with system-level task delegation  
- 🔧 **RISC-V, LLVM, and performance modeling**  
- ⚛️ Quantum computing simulations using Qiskit  
- 🔄 **Full-stack development (PERN)** for project deployment  
- 📈 Building algorithmic trading strategies based on technical indicators
