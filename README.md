I'm an Electrical Engineering student at Cooper Union studying the information-theoretic foundations of physical and computational intelligence, bridging rigorous mathematics with high-performance systems and compiler design. I build infrastructure to understand the fundamental limits of what computational systems can learn and process - proving theoretical bounds while engineering the tools that measure and approach them
